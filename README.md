# Ecommerce App vs. Website Sales Impact Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer data for an Ecommerce company to ascertain whether the company should focus more on their mobile app or website to boost sales. Utilizing linear regression analysis, we examine various customer behaviors, including average session length, time on app, time on website, and length of membership, to identify which platform (app or website) has a greater impact on sales.

## Objective

To determine the more effective sales platform for the Ecommerce company between the mobile app and website, guiding strategic decisions on marketing and development resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer information such as Email, Address, and Avatar color, along with numerical values representing:
- Average session length
- Time spent on the app
- Time spent on the website
- Length of membership

This information is crucial for understanding customer engagement and preferences.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and several libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. You can install the dependencies via pip:
